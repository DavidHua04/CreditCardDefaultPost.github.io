<h1>Predicting Credit-Card Default: A Data-Driven Exploration</h1>

<h2>1. The Decision Problem</h2>
<p>
Financial institutions routinely face the same fundamental question:
<strong>"Given a customer's profile and past payment behavior, how likely are they to default next month?"</strong>
The goal of my project was to build a model that helps answer exactly this question. 
The model does not replace human judgment; 
it simply provides a probability estimate based on historical patterns and offer the analysis on what influence the probability of customer default.
</p>

<h2>2. The Dataset and What It Reveals</h2>
<p>
I used the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/default-of-credit-card-clients-dataset" target="_blank">UCI Default of Credit Card Clients Dataset</a>. 
This dataset contains information on default payments, demographic factors, credit data, history of payment, and bill statements of credit card clients in Taiwan from April 2005 to September 2005. 
Each row corresponds to a credit-card holder in Taiwan, and the target variable is whether that person defaulted on their next payment.
</p>
<p>
The dataset includes demographics(gender, education level, marriage status, age), credit limit, six months of repayment history, and six months of billed and paid amounts. 
As you can see in the below Figure 1, some features are skewed and others are categorical but encoded as numbers.
</p>

</figure>
<br>
Besides, as the following Figure 2 and 3 depicted, some features contain large outliers.

    </figure>
</div>

<h2>3. The Modeling Approach</h2>
<p>
    <!-- I built and compared several prediction models, from simple benchmarks to advanced algorithms. 
    Their core difference is how they determine which factors in the data matter most. 
    To ensure a fair comparison on our specific problem, 
    I evaluated them with a specialized accuracy score (ROC-AUC) that measures how well they rank possibilities. -->
Think of this like trying different search methods to find a needle in a haystack. 
I used a few different "search strategies": a very basic guess (dummy classifier), a straightforward checklist method (logistic regression), 
and two more advanced, pattern-recognition techniques (random forest and gradient boosting models).
Each strategy searches for the important "needle" (the answer to our question) in a different way. 
I then rated each search method on how accurately it could point to where the needles actually are.
</p>

<h2>4. What the Models Found</h2>
<p>
The strongest model clearly outperformed the baseline methods. 
Although the validation scores were slightly higher than the test results, 
the final model still meaningfully distinguishes between higher-risk and lower-risk customers.
</p>
<p>
Across all models, several themes were consistent:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Repayment history was the strongest predictor.</li>
    <li>Bill amounts and payment patterns contributed additional signal.</li>
    <li>Demographics helped modestly but were not decisive.</li>
    </ul>
    Take a look at the below SHAP graph (Figure 4) and you can see what features matter most for deciding customers' default.

            <figcaption style="text-align: center;"><strong>Figure 4.</strong> Ranking of the importance of all features in final model.</figcaption>
        </figure>

<h2>5. Why These Results Are Interesting</h2>
<p>
Even with limited information (no credit scores or employment history), the model achieved strong ranking performance. 
This shows how much predictive structure exists in transactional behavior alone. 
It also highlights that demographic variables, while somewhat informative, play a relatively minor role compared to repayment patterns.
</p>

<h2>6. Caveats</h2>
<p>
Despite promising results, several issues limit reliability:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Old and narrow dataset.</strong> 
        I create new features by averaging the six months of billed and paid amounts seperately. 
        However, the data represents one bank in Taiwan in 2005. 
        Customer behavior and credit systems have changed since then and this averaging may not make any sense anymore.</li>
    <li><strong>Messy categorical fields.</strong> 
        Variables such as EDUCATION contain improper codes
        <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/default-of-credit-card-clients-dataset" target="_blank">(4 = others, 5 = unknown, 6 = unknown)</a>
        that do not match expected education levels. This may potentially misleading the models 
        because I do not do data cleaning on this feature to remove the duplicate unknown.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Extreme outliers.</strong> 
        My final model is tree-based. 
        However, there is a small number of very large bill amounts may cause tree-based models to overweight rare cases, 
        contributing to validation–test mismatch.</li>
</ul>

<h2>7. Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>
The model performs well for a dataset of this nature and provides a useful starting point for risk prioritization. 
However, due to data quality issues, age of the dataset, and hints of overfitting, 
it should be treated as an exploration rather than a deployment-ready system.
